## About

Restaurant reviews app was designed to help you choose restaurant in your neighborhood. The app is responsive, accessible and ready for offline use.

## Quick start

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. Run `gulp dist` to make a distributable version of app. Browser-sync should open the page for you at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. If browsersync doesn't work, in *dist* folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

4. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## ES6
